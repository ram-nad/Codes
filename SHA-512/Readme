This is the C code for implementing SHA 512.
SHA-512 creates a 512 bit hash value for arbitary length of input message.
This implemetation requires the input message to be stored in a file from where message will be read byte by byte.
This implementation is endianess-independent. The program test endianess of the system at runtime and perform
operations according to it.

The reference used for SHA-512 algorithm is
Chapter-11 Crypographic Hash Functions of book:
Cryptography and Network Security Principles and Practice by William Stallings 5th Edition.

The test driver code for implemntation is in driver.c
This calculates the SHA-512 hash of "abc"
The Hash Value (in Hexadecimal is):
